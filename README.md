# Guessing Game (Console Version)

A simple number guessing game that runs in the browser using JavaScript prompt() and console logs.

# How the game works
- The user first enters a maximum number.
- The program generates a random number between 1 and the max.
- The user keeps guessing until:
- They guess the correct number, or
- They type "quit" to exit.

# Commands / Game Flow
Enter any number → program checks your guess.
quit → exits the game.

# Hint messages:
- "Your guess is too small"
- "Your guess is too large"

# How to run
- Open index.html in any browser.
- The browser will show prompt dialogs.
- Open the console (F12 → Console) to see game messages and results.
